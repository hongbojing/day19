# day19
From today I want to begin a series of daily exercise for a few web programming languages, since I think that doing programming is like working out in the gym, you have to do it every day to keep your skills sharp.
<br/>
Take me as an example, because I have to find a job now, I learn and prepare differnet projects every day, from html to less/sass, from database to app design, it's really impossible for me to stay on one language for more than a week, so I kind of keep forgetting exactly the language in a short time.
<br/>
Thanks to DASH, I could look up to the dictionaries on my mac when I forget how to create something, anyway, I still consider it important for a developer to program without using the references, which is also the reason that I create this series, anyone who wants to take the exercise with me is welcome, I will try my best to make the tutorials understoodable.
